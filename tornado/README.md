------------------------------------------------------------------

TORNADO is a general purpose parser to produce grammars of
single-sequence RNA secondary structure. TORNADO is written in C, lex
and yacc. TORNADO allows to implement a wide range of RNA grammars
using a specific language described in the documentation. TORNADO
includes most of the inference algorithms usual for single-sequence
RNA secondary structure prediction.
