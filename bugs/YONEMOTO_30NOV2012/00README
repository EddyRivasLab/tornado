Dear Dr. Rivas,

I'm Haruka, a graduate student, who previously reported the bug for TORNADO.Â  Thank you for your quick response and fixing bugs at that time.

I hesitated to email such things, but today I would like to tell you that I got an error message in using "grm-train". The following lines are the command line I used
and the error message after the execution:

--------------------
./grm-train --count --bwe --TEL basic_grammar.grm input.txt output.txt fc_file.txt
assign_count_disegment_atom(): wrong boundaries l=388
---------------------

This error occurs at line 643 in the file "grm_parsetree.c" but I couldn't find the causes of this error. This function is actually hugely related to our analysis
which we nearly finishes for staring to write our manuscript. I would be very happy if you have the time to fix the error.

The files used for the function are attached, I hope that they would help the improvement of your software package...

Thank you very much in advance,
Yours sincerely,
Haruka.
